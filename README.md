## About Snack Swap

Snack Swap is a digital platform built with (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) that is designed to connect college students with surplus food items to those facing food insecurity. According to United Nations, "2 billion people in the world do not have reg- ular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food. In 2022, 148 million children had stunted growth and 45 million children under the age of 5 were affected by wasting" (United Nations). Our solution aims to reduce food waste on campuses and raise awareness about food security by facilitating the redistribution of surplus food while ensuring access to nutritious options for students that are in need. With that, our platform serves as a reliable source of food for those experiencing food insecurity and promotes environmental sustainability in college camuses by encouraging the reduction of food waste and aligining this to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #2: Zero Hunger. 

## Our Features

* Add Listing: Users will be able to easily add new food listings through a user-friendly survey.
* Filter Option: Users can easily navigate through different categories such as Meat or Dairy, Beverages, Produce, and Non-perishable items (canned, boxed, dried fruit) which simplifies the selection process for all users.
* User Login + Claim Item Notification: Users will be able to claim their items and receive a notification containing the details of the claimed item along with their contact information.
